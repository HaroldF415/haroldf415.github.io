                    <p class="blog_subheading"><strong>Parallax Scrolling</strong></p>

                    <p class="blog_p">Still following some tutorials from Travis Neilson at DevTips and the one that caught my eye was the Parallax Scrolling <a class="links" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STwoa-9jxi0&list=PLqGj3iMvMa4IyCbhul-PdeiDqmh4ooJzk">series</a>. At first hearing this term I was confused as to what it was. To be honest I thought it had something to to with <em>Parallax</em> the fictional comic book supervillain in the DC Comics Universe. Anyways it is far from that. Apparently the term "Parallax" was given to the visual effect of 2D side scrolling videogames that moved different background _img at different movement speeds to create and illusion of depth. This was achieved by making the background of said video game move at a slower speed than the foreground to give it that effect of it being further away. This same idea is used and applied to site design. In this case web designer move the background and foreground of a site at different speeds than the rest of the page. There are many reasons why web designers implement Parallax Scrolling to their sites. For me I'm going to implement it to my site for practice. I've added the code to my GitHub <a class="links" href="https://github.com/HaroldF415/Parallax_001">here</a>. To start I looked for pictures that had a good background that I could blur out in Photoshop. After I looked for a clean image that I could extract and put in the foreground of the background. After completing the example without any problems I noticed a few flaws:</p>

                    <ul class="blog_ul">
                        <li>When resizing the browser the fore_img did not move with the background of the header.</li>
                        <li>Tried asking for help from the YouTuber 'DevTips' but I don't think he understood my question.</li>
                        <li>Next I will try to ask this same question on Reddit.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p class="blog_p">Had a talk with one of my programming friends and asked him to take a look at the current project I was working on. Turned out he gave me some advise about installing Node.js, NPM, and Bower. I've heard about these web technologies but never looked into them (He's been telling me too look into them but school/work got in the way).</p>

                    <p class="blog_subheading"><strong>What is Node.js?</strong></p>

                    <p class="blog_p">Simply put Node.js is JavaScript that has access to sockets, databases, files, etc. The same way other languages like PHP, Python, or Ruby have always been able to do. To actually understand this better ( myself included ) I go back to JavaScript's <em>Execution Context</em>.</p>

                    <p class="blog_subheading"><strong>What is Execution Context?</strong></p>

                    <p class="blog_p">The environment in which JavaScript code is run is very important, and is evaluated as one of the following types of code:</p>

                    <ul class="blog_ul">
                        <li><strong>Global </strong> - Default environment where code is executed for the first time.</li>
                        <li><strong>Function </strong> - Whenever the flow of execution enters a function body.</li>
                        <li><strong>Eval </strong> - Text to be executed instead of the internal eval function.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <img class="blog_img" alt="Execution_Context" title="Execution_Context_Code" src="img/blog_img/js_context.jpg"/>

                    <p class="blog_p"><code>Global context</code> is highlighted in purple. <code>Function context</code> is highlighted in green, blue and orange. Global context can be accessed from any other context in your code. There can be any number of <code>function contexts</code>, meaning each one of these function calls can create a new context. This creates a scope where anything declared within said function cannot be directly accessed from the outside.</p>
                    <p class="blog_p">The example above has a function that can access a variable declared outside of its scope, but an outside context can not access the variables / declared inside.</p>

                    <ul class="blog_ul">
                        <li>If we are inside the function called <code>Person()</code> we can access the global variable <code>printHello</code>.</li>
                        <li>If we are inside the purple area, we can not access variables like <code>firstName</code> or <code>lastName</code>.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p class="blog_p">The Execution Context is where code is executed from. There is the <code>Global Execution Context</code>, and there is <code>Function Execution Context</code>. A JavaScript program always starts with the Global Execution Context, and when a function is called, it enters that function's Execution Context. This context is added to the <code>"Call Stack"</code>, which can be visualized as layers. So now you have two layers, the Global Execution Context and one Function Context.</p>

                    <p class="blog_p">There are many things to say about the Execution Context but that will be all for now. Next getting back to installing NPM.</p>

                    <p class="blog_subheading"><strong>What is NPM?</strong></p>

                    <p class="blog_p">NPM is</p>
