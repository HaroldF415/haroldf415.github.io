                        <p>Posted on: <time datetime="2016-02-20T22:00:60Z">February 20, 2016</time></p>

                    </header>
                    <p>So a friend of my agreed to do some late night pair programming. We sort of did not do any programming because we got caught up trying to find the solution for <a href="https://projecteuler.net/problem=3">Project Euler - Problem #3.</a> Anyways I did not get very far I lost myself trying to understand the concept of Sieve of Atkin <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sieve_of_Atkin">algorithm</a></p>
                    <p>Moving away from this we decide to watch a couple of videos from Travis Neilson over on his YouTube Channel <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCyIe-61Y8C4_o-zZCtO4ETQ">DevTips.</a>The videos mostly talked about <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLqGj3iMvMa4IOmy04kDxh_hqODMqoeeCy">CSS Basics</a> I found this really interesting and it served as a refresher course for me. I believed it helped my friend have a better understanding of CSS3 but I made the mistake of not going over HTML5 first. Guess this will be left out for another time.</p>
                    <p>The reason I decided to write a blog about this was because of how Travis talk bout selectors and their <strong>POINT SYSTEM!!</strong> I honestly did not know about this until now. I mean I had a basic understanding of how CSS worked and it is based on cascading rules. Meaning the rules closest to the bottom will take effect.</p>
                    <p>Anyway I'm rambling on the title of the video was <a href="https://youtu.be/fy07HYm-geM?list=PLqGj3iMvMa4IOmy04kDxh_hqODMqoeeCy">Specificity</a> and to have a better grasp on what this does we must first have an understanding of CSS's cascading part in cascading stylesheets.</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            <ul>
                                <li>
                                    The first way stylesheets cascade, is that a single style can effect multiple HTML elements.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    For example, let's say we have a few paragraph tags. Then let's say that we change our mind and we want all of our paragraphs on our website to be red. We can write one simple style to do this.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    All of the elements that match the criteria of that style rule, will be effected by it. In this case, every paragraph. Notice That our list was not effected.
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <ul>
                                <li>
                                    The second way that stylesheets cascade is similar to the first, but reversed. That is, one html element can be effected by many styles, in different ways, all at the same time.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    Let's say we write a general style that makes all of our paragraphs have red text, and then later on we target the first paragraph and make it 18px large. It is now both red and 18px large. See? Cascading.
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            The third way they cascade is what allows us to use the powers of stylesheets to make large scale websites. In this way, one stylesheet can be applied to many pages across a website, or even multiple sites!
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                    <em>*The points made above where from Travis Neilson & Carlos Montoya*</em>
                    <p>So after this it could be said that if there are two equal CSS rules on the CSS file, the browser will apply the one it reads last. To apply the changes the first rule has we must add another tag to the selector and so forth thus making it more specific. <a href="http://specificity.keegan.st/">Here</a> is a website that Travis brought up on the video at which time everything I knew about CSS made <em>MORE SENSE!!</em></p>
