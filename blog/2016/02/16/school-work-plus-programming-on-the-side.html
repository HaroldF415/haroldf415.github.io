            <p>In an effort to keep track of my progress as a Full Stack Web Developer I decided to write code at least 2hrs per day. The rest will be focused on school work.</p>
            <p>It's constant war in my head. One side wants to program as much as possible before graduating college and the other is trying to keep my grades up so when I do graduate from college I don't end up with a bad GPA. Which currently is not looking so good.</p>
            <p>I will not turn into a political blog or anything but the American Education System really does suck. I understand that in college they try to make you an educated person all around but when will I need Art History 101!?!?! </p>
            <p>Well that's what I wanted to get out of my system. It is no joke because my time to graduate is soon approaching and I have no leads on any internships. It also doesn't help that it is a requirement that you have at least one intership under your belt before you graduate.</p>
            <p>Like I said I will be trying to touch code at least 2 - 3 hrs per day.</p>
            <p>Over the holiday (President's Day) weekend I managed to put together the free online classes for programing I'm following and added a few more to the mix</p>
            <ul>
                <li>CodeCademy</li>
                <li>Udemy</li>
                <li>Udacity</li>
                <li>The Odin Project</li>
                <li>FreeCodeCamp</li>
                <li>TreeHouse</li>
            </ul>
            <p>I started learning to program back in the day with CodeCademy so it feels right to finish that course first. Obviously I will finish the free content first and then move on to the payment plan which offers quizzes and more projects. I do not intend to start paying now as it feels like a waste.</p>
            <p>Why you ask? Well simply put I'm back  in school for the Spring 2016,  attend a work study internship (not a programming internship) and help out at home and honestly I can't squeeze in hours of programing into my schedule let alone pay for them. So yeah when I have more time to spare I will start paying for these services.</p>
            <p>Also before I forget this 2hrs of programing will include committing something to GitHub everyday. To have a very nice streak going and learn something in the process.</p>
